# What is working 

Updating the rules file led to noticeable improvements in how the AI agent worked:

Encouraging the agent to think before coding helped it avoid rushing and produced more accurate solutions.

Having the agent restate the problem and highlight assumptions made it easier to catch unclear requirements early.

Incorporating planning and step-by-step breakdowns resulted in more structured and maintainable code.

Adding rules to prevent hallucinations reduced mistakes and the use of fake APIs or libraries.

Dividing responses into analysis, solution, and risk sections made them easier to read and more reliable.
