Challenges Faced

At first, I wasn’t sure how to connect my local repo to GitHub, which caused errors when pushing branches. I also had to figure out whether my branch was main or master and ensure files were committed before pushing.

Early attempts to push failed because the repo had no commits, and the AI agent sometimes suggested steps out of order. I solved these issues by committing the files first, confirming the branch name, adding the remote, and then pushing to GitHub.

These challenges were resolved through careful, step-by-step adjustments rather than starting over.
